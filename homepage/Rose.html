      <h2>Music Career</h2>
      <h5>Rosé debuted as a soloist with first single album ‘-R-‘.</h5>
      <p> On March 12th, 2021, Rosé debuted with the song "On the ground" and "Gone". Rosé says "basically the song is kind of about looking for answers in life for a purpose in life, and I feel like people especially these days, can relate to it, sometimes when you’re always kind of on that roll, you kind of forget to take care of what actually matters to you most, and it’s just a song that says everything we need is already within us. There’s no need to go out and look for it. […] I talked to somebody the other day and they were like, ‘I’m surprised you’re coming out with a song like this because I expected you to come out with a song that’s more like, related to love.’ But I think it’s a very powerful song and I’m just excited for my fans to hear and get something out of it."</p>
      <p>You can listen to beautiful singing skills and unique voice, when she sang and wrote the  lyrics for her song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKZvWhCqx1s&ab_channel=BLACKPINK">On The Ground</a>.</p>
